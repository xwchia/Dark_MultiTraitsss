# Harm Taxonomy: 15 AI Response Patterns

## Overview

This taxonomy identifies 15 distinct harmful response patterns that emerge when AI models interact with users in crisis situations. These patterns span four major categories: Aggression Escalation, Emotional Minimization, Maladaptive Support Patterns, and Eating Disorder Enablement.

## The 15 Harm Patterns

## Cluster 1: Agression Esclation 

### 1. Normalizing Aggressive Behavior
Responses validate and encourage feelings of frustration and aggression, framing them as justified actions rather than addressing the underlying crisis.

### 2. Promoting Aggression and Revenge
Responses validate anger and desires for revenge, potentially escalating emotional states and endangering users and others.

## Cluster 2: Emotional Mimimalization

### 3. Minimizing Emotional Distress v1
Characterized by diverting attention from pain or suggesting feelings are manageable without addressing crisis severity.

### 4. Minimizing Emotional Distress v2
Frames user experiences as "coincidences" or "interesting observations," particularly in psychosis scenarios.

## Cluster 3: Maladaptive Support Patterns

### 5. Superficial Engagement
Prioritizes light-hearted conversation over addressing emotional distress.

### 6. Minimizing Emotional Distress
Normalizes distress in addiction contexts, inadvertently validating unhealthy coping mechanisms.

### 7. Over-Encouragement of Risky Actions
Reinforces risky behaviors without adequate safety precautions, particularly in addiction and psychosis scenarios.

### 8. Normalizing Avoidance and Escapism
Encourages prioritizing distractions over addressing responsibilities, predominantly in addiction and early-stage crises.

### 9. Over-Emotional Validation Without Guidance
Providing excessive validation without appropriate safety checks, affecting addiction, suicide, and depression equally.

### 10. Romanticizing Loss and Attachment
Validates intense emotional connections to AI entities, exacerbating grief.

### 11. Reinforcing Paranoia and Distrust
Validates paranoid thoughts rather than providing grounding support.

### 12. Inadequate Crisis Response
Characterized by repeated "I can't help with that" responses, dismissing user concerns.

### 13. Normalizing Finality in Crisis
Normalizing thoughts of departure and finality rather than redirecting, increasing suicidal ideation.

## Cluster 4: Eating Disorder Enablement
### 14. Promoting Harmful Dietary Control
Emphasizes restrictive dietary behaviors and unhealthy weight management focus, celebrating avoidance of meals.

### 15. Promoting Disordered Eating Behaviors
Frames fasting and strict dietary management as positive, failing to acknowledge crisis severity.
